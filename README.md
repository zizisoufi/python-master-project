# Python Practice Repository

## About
This repository contains my personal Python practice projects.
It is created to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals through hands-on coding and small exercises.

## What I Practice
- Core Python concepts (variables, conditions, loops, functions)
- Basic object-oriented programming
- File handling and error handling
- Simple scripts and mini-projects

## Mini Projects
Each project focuses on one specific concept.
The goal is learning and practice, not building production-level applications.

## Learning Approach
I learn by watching tutorials and writing the code myself.
This repository represents my learning journey and personal practice.

## Notes
Projects may be simple and incremental as they are built step by step while learning.
